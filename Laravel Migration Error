Add following code to AppServiceProvider.php (/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php)

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema; //NEW: Import Schema

function boot()
{
    Schema::defaultStringLength(191); //NEW: Increase StringLength
}

in AppServiceProvider didn't work for me. What worked for was editing the database.php file in config folder. Just edit 
'charset' => 'utf8mb4',
'collation' => 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci',
to 
'charset' => 'utf8',
'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',
